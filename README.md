revert: Custom Error Messages
The revert function allows you to explicitly revert a transaction and provide a custom error message. It's useful for more specific error handling based on conditional logic.

assert: Unrecoverable Errors
The assert function is used to check for conditions that should never be false. If the condition is false, it triggers an unrecoverable error, effectively halting the transaction. 

require: Enforcing Preconditions
The require function is commonly used to enforce preconditions in a Solidity contract. It checks a specified condition, and if the condition is not met, the transaction is reverted with an error message.
